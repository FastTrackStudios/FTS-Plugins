//! Vello scene overlay painters for audio metering.
//!
//! Each painter implements `SceneOverlay` from `nih_plug_dioxus` and reads from
//! the shared `Arc<*State>` types provided by `meter-dsp`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! 1. Create the DSP struct (e.g. [`meter_dsp::spectrum::SpectrumAnalyzer`]).
//! 2. Clone its `.state` arc for the painter.
//! 3. Pass the painter to the Dioxus `SceneOverlay` hook in your plugin editor.
