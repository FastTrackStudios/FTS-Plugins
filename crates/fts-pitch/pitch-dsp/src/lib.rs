//! FTS Pitch — Real-time pitch shifting DSP.
//!
//! Four algorithm modes, selectable at runtime:
//!
//! 1. **FreqDivider** — Analog-style frequency division (Boss OC-2).
//!    Zero latency, synthy square-wave character.
//!
//! 2. **PLL** — Phase-locked loop tracking oscillator.
//!    Zero latency, warmer sub with saw/triangle waveforms.
//!
//! 3. **Granular** — Fixed-ratio granular pitch shifter.
//!    ~512–1024 sample latency, natural tone.
//!
//! 4. **PSOLA** — Pitch-synchronous overlap-add.
//!    ~1152 sample latency, highest quality monophonic.
